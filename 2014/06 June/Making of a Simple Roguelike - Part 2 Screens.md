###Wherein I admit to my Failure

First of my failures is not getting another post up. 
Sorry about that as I just started my internship and it is a bit of a sharp turn about for my mind. 
Anyway my lack of posting is only partly having to learn another language in only a couple days. 
Honestly at this point I have the basics so its only learning the specific keywords for it. 

The big problem and failure on my part is not being able to pick something and stick with it. 
I have in my spare time coded and recoded my method of storing the three default screens. 
There is no way to get around the fact that it is just a few giant blobs of characters. 
So yeah, at the point where I am typing this I am going to stick with just hardcoding them in.
