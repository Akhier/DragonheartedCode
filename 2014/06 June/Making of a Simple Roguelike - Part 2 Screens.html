<h3 id="wherein-i-admit-to-my-failure">Wherein I Admit to My Failure</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of my failures is not getting another post up. 
Sorry about that as I just started my internship and it is a bit of a sharp turn about for my mind. 
Anyway my lack of posting is only partly having to learn another language in only a couple days. 
Honestly at this point I have the basics so its only learning the specific keywords for it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big problem and failure on my part is not being able to pick something and stick with it. 
I have in my spare time coded and recoded my method of storing the three default screens. 
There is no way to get around the fact that it is just a few giant blobs of characters. 
So yeah, at the point where I am typing this I am going to stick with just hardcoding them in. </p>
<h3 id="now-for-the-screens-themselves">Now for the Screens Themselves</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game screen where you will spend most of your time is important and thus I will begin with it.
It was the easiest and probably hardest screen to design. 
Even now the design isn&#39;t complete. 
I was doing some tests on my map gen and figured out that a short map made with it feels best for this. 
This means that I actually ended up with too much room. </p>

</code></pre><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of walls is actually the size of the map. 
It makes for a compact and relatively lineir experaince when I must admit my map gen wallows in dead ends and confusion normally. 
Letters are where equipment will be listed as I want it to be descriptive since there are only five spots. 
Now I just have to figure out what to do with the side. 
This doesn&#39;t matter though and it could just end up blank so onwards. </p>
<p>Start up and what does the screen you see look like? </p>

</code></pre><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again I am dealing with too much space. 
Anyway it doesn&#39;t look too bad. 
In game there will be a frame around whichever option is selected at the moment. 
But all that aside we now have all the screens we need. 
Yes there is a pause screen but I am going to take a shortcut with that. 
Libtcod can make a frame which overwrites what it is drawn over so I will simply be drawing that and then the options. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that out of the way though I now have to put it into the code. 
I am thinking a simple class that just has getStartScreen and getGameScreen which takes the argument of a char**.
It will actually be somewhat easier then it could be because of something I learned recently. 
Techincally it is something I should have known already but sometimes you just need stuff pointed out to you. 
The important thing I learned was that in notepad++ you can search and replace with regular expressions. 
I knew this but it took someone else pointing out that it means I can search for (.) and replace \1&#39;,&#39; which will put that between each character. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that remains is caused by how I store the map I would have to rotate it because I go map[width][height]. 
I do this because it means when I am doing stuff in the code any array dealing with the map can be accessed with x,y. 
The problem in the past that I had was I would do it the other way and then get it all mixed up. 
So now I could just do the work, on the other hand I think just making a couple of private arrays going the other way will work fine. 
Once I put that down in code it seemed to work so I should be done with this. </p>
