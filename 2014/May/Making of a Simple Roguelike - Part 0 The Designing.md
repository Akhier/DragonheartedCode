###Design It First

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been on the cusp of making a roguelike for a long time now. 
As of Late I have mostly been stuck at redisigning my map generator over and over. 
My most complete attempt was a couple years ago for a 7drl and it failed because of early design choices. 
This basically means I could have avoided it if I had planned ahead and so this time around I will do so. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start let's layout what the game will be like overall. 
I want a simple twelve level dungeon with only a dash of flavor. 
Each level introduces a new enemy type with a few types from previous levels thrown in. 
There will be a "boss" on each level but you are not required to figth them ever. 
The combat will be low hp and probably the most complex bit because of time manegment. 
With the high level view layed out lets take a closer look at each bit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of levels was chosen at random. 
I actually had originally planned for 26 levels with each one devoted to a letter. 
That was a bit overboard and I decided to limit it for this. 
Each of the levels will be generated with my simple map gen so that is actually taken care of though I will probably go over that at a future date. 
As for the story there won't be much of it. 
Something really short about wanting to join the adventurers guild and this being the entrance exam.
Probably will fit it on the start screen. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the enemies as I stated each level will introduce a new type. 
The original plan was for me to use the whole alphabet but my requirement for enemies made that not very practical. 
What I required was each enemy type being in some way unique. 
There is actually a little notebook I keep on me and it has a lot of notes in it. 
What my general concensus over a few months of design in that notebook is that 26 is too many for something as simple as I want. 
So yeah, with only 12 things I need to design this should be a lot easier for me to handle. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a boss on each level was originaly going to be a secret feature. 
Since I am posting about it that is no longer the case so the second purpose now will take the forefront. 
Basically the plan for the bosses is that they only show up if you defeat all enemies on a level. 
They also are the only form of advancement of your character besides hp. 
If you defeat a boss then when you go down the stairs you will be given an option of 3 power ups to choose from. 
The catch with the bosses is that they break the rules. 
Of course you don't have to fight them as the only goal on a level is to proceed to the next. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting bit where I will be dabbling the most with is combat. 
I want a bit more positioning and tactics without resorting quite to everything only having a single hitpoint. 
The player character will have a max hp of the level times 5 and it is restored when you go down to the next level. 
Monsters on the other hand will only have 1 hit point or if armored 2. 
Combat itself is where the most complicated bits will probably reside. 
There are pages of notes in my notebook on the time system I want to use and it is much too complicated for this. 
My basic plan to simplify it is reduce the numbers. 
As it is written I have all kinds of interesting mechanics but for this game I can't expect people to learn it. 
By reducing the numbers down to a range of 1 to 10 then even without understanding of the system people can comprehend it. 
Though I will still keep some of the interesting things such as damage happining at the end of the attack. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above gives a decent outline though it probably is missing some things. 
While randomly choosen the number of levels feels right. 
I beleive I can manage 12 unique feeling enemies. 
The concept behind the bosses has been in my head for a while so should work out. 
With the combat it might take some jury rigging of my original design but that happens. 
So yeah overall it should all fit together but I still need to set this all into a nice bullet pointed list of goals.
